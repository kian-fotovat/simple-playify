# Privacy Policy for Playify

**Last Updated:** 06/29/2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Playify ("the Bot") collects, uses, and handles data when you use it on your Discord server.

## Data We Collect

The Bot is designed to be privacy-focused. We only collect and process data that is essential for its core functionality.

**1. Server and Channel Information:**
   - The Bot stores server IDs and channel IDs to manage server-specific settings, such as language preferences and "kawaii mode".
   - It also temporarily keeps track of the voice channel and text channel it is operating in to play music and send status messages.

**2. User-Provided Content (Message Content Intent):**
   - The Bot requires the Message Content Intent for one specific feature: to detect when a user uploads an audio or video file attachment.
   - **We do not read, log, or store the text content of any user messages.**
   - When a file attachment is detected, the Bot's only action is to add a '▶️' reaction to the message. It does not store the file or its content. The playback of the file is only initiated upon an explicit user action (clicking the reaction).

**3. Data We DO NOT Collect:**
   - We do not collect or store user IDs, usernames, or any personally identifiable information (PII).
   - We do not log message content.
   - We do not track user activity across Discord.

## How We Use Data

- **To Provide Functionality:** The collected data is used exclusively to deliver the Bot's features, such as playing music, managing the queue, and applying server-specific settings.
- **To Improve the Service:** We do not use any user data for analytics or service improvement.

## Data Storage and Security

- Server settings are stored in the Bot's memory and are not permanently saved in a database, meaning they are reset if the bot restarts (unless you implement a database later).
- The Bot is hosted on secure infrastructure, and we take reasonable measures to protect the data we handle.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties.

## Your Rights

Users can opt-out of the file-playing feature by not uploading files or by having a server administrator restrict the bot's permissions in a channel. For any questions or concerns about your data, please contact us through the bot's support server or official listing page.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy in the future. We will notify users of any significant changes.
