<a id="installation"></a>
## (＾∀＾) Installation

You can run Playify in two ways. The Docker method is recommended for most users as it's simpler and manages all dependencies for you.

### (🐳) Method 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get the bot running.

1.  **Clone the repository and enter it:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alan7383/playify.git
    cd playify
    ```
2.  **Create your secret file:**
    Copy the example file to create your own configuration.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, **edit the `.env` file** and fill in your tokens.
    ```ini
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
    GENIUS_TOKEN=your_genius_api_token
    ```
3.  **Fire it up!**
    This command will build the container and run the bot in the background.
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```
    To view the bot's logs, use `docker compose logs -f`.

### (🛠️) Method 2: Manual Setup

**Requirements:**
*   Python 3.9+
*   FFmpeg installed & in your system's PATH
*   Git

**Steps:**
1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alan7383/playify.git
    cd playify
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    playwright install
    ```
3.  Copy & configure environment:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    **Edit the `.env` file** with your tokens as shown in the Docker method.
4.  Run the bot:
    ```bash
    python playify.py
    ```

### Inviting the Bot to Discord (for both methods)
*   Go to your Discord Developer Portal.
*   Enable the **Guilds**, **Voice States**, and **Message Content** intents for your bot.
*   Generate an invite link with the `Connect`, `Speak`, and `Send Messages` permissions.
*   Add the bot to your server and enjoy `/play`!

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
## (｀・ω・´) Troubleshooting

*   **FFmpeg not found**: Ensure it's installed & in your system's PATH. (Docker setup handles this for you!)
*   **Spotify errors**: Verify your API credentials in the `.env` file.
*   **Bot offline/unresponsive**: Check your `DISCORD_TOKEN` and bot permissions in the Developer Portal.
*   **Direct link issues**: Ensure the URL points directly to an audio file and is publicly accessible.

<a id="privacy--data"></a>
## (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ Privacy & Data

*   **Self-hosted**: All logs are local to your machine. No telemetry is sent.
